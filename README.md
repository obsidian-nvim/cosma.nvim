# cosma.nvim

cosma ü§ù neovim

**WIP**

This is mainly for using in combination with [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim), but is also available as a standalone plugin, and is willing to provide integration with other note-taking plugin for neovim.


## TODO

- [ ] lua table to generate config.
- [ ] `Cosma open` (`Obsidian graph`) to modelize and open in browser.
- [ ] install a local copy of cosma if not present.
